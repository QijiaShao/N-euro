Provides demo code for N-euro Predictor paper.

## requirement
1. The main model required for this demo code is the PytorchForecasting library.
   you can find the installation guidance here: https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html 
2. After installation of this librabry, find the path where this library is installed. For example, mine is at '/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pytorch_forecasting/'; Inside the library, go to 'data/' folder and you will see a file called 'timeseries.py'. Replace the original file with the one in the supp folder. 
3. Install the jupyter notebook. Reference: https://jupyter.org/install
